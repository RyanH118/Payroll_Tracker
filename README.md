# Payroll_Tracker

## Description

I was motivated in this challenge to get the employees data so we can track it and be able to see it all together. The goal I wanted to comlete was track the data which was first and last name and the salaries of all employess that were submitted into the page. I also wanted to find the average salary between all the employees that were added to the page and to pick a random employee to win in a drawing. I got a better understanding of javascript functions, loops and math. I also learned to comment more on the actual code to help others and myself if I were to look back on it.
